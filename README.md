# My-Landing-Page
HTML and CSS combine project 

 HTML project exampleâ€¯for beginners is this one, which you can create and include in your portfolio. A landing page is a single web page that promotes one or more goods and services while directing site visitors to carry out various actions, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, etc. You need to combine CSS with HTML to develop even the most basic landing page. 

A landing page must be appealing and purposeful if it hopes to persuade visitors to take some sort of action. Your styling of the landing page should centre on selecting the right colour schemes, page layout, etc. Additionally, you must ensure that the page's elements do not overlap or be put incorrectly. 

HTML Description:
The HTML code begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which specifies the document type. Inside the <html> tags, we have the <head> section that contains the title of the page and a link to an external CSS file, style.css, which is used to style the landing page.
  
The <body> section is where the content of the landing page resides. It starts with a <header> element that includes a heading (<h1>) and a paragraph describing the purpose of the page.

The main content of the landing page is organized within a <section> element with the ID of "main-section." It consists of a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph explaining more about the page. Additionally, there is a call-to-action button (<a>) with the class "cta-button" that redirects users to the contact section of the page.

Next, there is a <section> element with the ID of "features-section" that displays a heading and an unordered list (<ul>) of features, represented by list items (<li>).

The contact section is defined by a <section> element with the ID of "contact-section." It includes a heading and a <form> with input fields for name and email, as well as a textarea for the message. Lastly, there is a submit button (<input type="submit">) for users to submit the form.

Finally, a <footer> element is used to display copyright information.

CSS Description:
The CSS code begins by targeting the body element to set the font family to Arial, sans-serif, and removing any default margins and paddings.

The styles for the header, sections, and footer are defined by selecting their respective elements. Padding is added to provide spacing around the content, and the text is centered using text-align: center.

The header has a background color of #f2f2f2 to create contrast, and the heading (h1) within it has a color of #333.

The call-to-action button with the class "cta-button" is displayed as an inline block with padding and has a background color of #333 and text color of #fff.

The features section has a background color of #eaeaea for visual separation from the other sections.

The unordered list (ul) within the features section has its default list styles removed (list-style: none), and each list item (li) is displayed without any bullet points.

For the contact form, the input fields and textarea have a width of 100% to span the entire width of their parent container. Margins are added at the bottom for spacing between the elements. The submit button has a background color of #333, text color of #fff, and no border.

The footer has a background color of #333 and text color of #fff to create a contrasting effect.

By combining HTML and CSS in this manner, you can create an appealing and purposeful landing page that promotes goods or services and encourages visitors to take action. The CSS styling ensures that the elements are visually appealing, properly positioned, and do not overlap.
